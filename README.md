# GALLERY

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

This Project is a Gallery where the user can view and like pictures on the site. I started by setting up the backbones of the server with React and Nodemon. I then made two modules for listing each picture in the gallery and another for managing each picture individually. A GET request to the server is used when the client boots up to retrieve the gallery and display it on the virtual DOM. When the user likes a picture, a PUT request is made to update that specific picture and up the like count by 1. Additionally, I added some CSS styling to make the site more appealing.
